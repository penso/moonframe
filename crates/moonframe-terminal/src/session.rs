//! A terminal's program, whatever [`Backend`](crate::Backend) runs it, with
//! an emulator reading it.
//!
//! Three threads per session: one reads the pane's output, one runs the
//! emulator (it owns it: libghostty's types cannot change threads), and the
//! window's, which reads the latest [`Screen`] and writes keys straight to
//! the pane. The emulator thread drains every chunk waiting before it
//! publishes, so a burst of output costs one snapshot.
