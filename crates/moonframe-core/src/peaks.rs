//! How close each module's Luau state comes to its limits, for the perf log
//! (`moonframe::perf`), so a limit is changed on what mods really use.
//!
//! Read as each call ends: garbage not yet collected counts, and memory a
//! call took and gave back within itself does not. Luau gives no hook for
//! the moment in between, so a peak is what was seen, not the exact most.
